## Relational Databases

Model data by storing rows and columns in table. The power of the relational database lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationship between those tables involved in the query.

 A relation in defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns. All the data_referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.

 ## SQL

 Structured Query Language - used to issue commands to the database (create a table, retrieve some data, insert data, delete data), CRUD.
