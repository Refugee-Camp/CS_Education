# From children to parent - pass a function from parent as a props from parent to children which update state of parent

Create: spread the old elements into a new array and stick the new one at the end (or the beginning, your choice)
Update: map through the elements. In the callback: if the ID of the current element matches the ID of the thing you want to update, return a new object literal, spread the old object in, and add keys after the spread for the updated properties, else return the existing object.
Delete: filter, testing each object to see if the ID doesnâ€™t equal the ID of the one you want to delete
