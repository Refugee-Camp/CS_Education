## Identify the Problem
When you run into a programming problem, it's easy to get lost in the code. Take a step back and think about what you're trying to accomplish beyond the output. What is the essential goal you're trying to reach? For example, what are the needs of the customer you're coding for? Determining the answer to this establishes your context and makes sure you keep the appropriate perspective on the reality of the problem.

## Identify the Output That Would Solve the Problem
After you've figured out what general solution you want, it's time to get a little more specific. What output is going to fit that solution? For example, maybe you can pinpoint that your result should be an average of numbers, or a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. Or a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, divided diagonally into two triangles. Or a beautiful Persian rug that really ties the room together. It all depends on what the problem is. But once you've determined the precise output, you can start building a plan towards it.

## Name the Procedure That Fixes the Problem
What will produce the desired output? If we need that average, we add together all of the values in our set and divide by the number of the values, to get a whole number with two-places of numbers after the decimal. If we need a sandwich, we assemble the peanut butter, jelly and bread, and make a diagonal cut. If we need the perfect Persian rug ... well, that might get complicated. But there are steps to take to get it. Identify the steps and find a place to start.

## Identify What Inputs Are Needed to Create the Output
In order to start the steps of getting the output, we have to know what items we're going to need during the process. To continue our examples:

- If we want an average of numbers, we need all of those values and the total number of values;
- If we want a sandwich, we'll need the ingredients (peanut butter, jelly and bread) and tools (a knife, cutting board, plate);
- If we want a rug, we'll need thread, a loom and a pattern (or maybe the address of a rug dealership and directions to get there plus a truck, if we want to skip a few steps).
No input, no output. You now know what your output should be, so figure out what input will get it.

## Define the Procedure’s Implementation
Because earlier we named the procedure we'll need to use, we have an idea of what implementation will be like. But, just like how we needed to get detailed about the input, we need to dig into implementation and build out our understanding of its process.

Implementation, simply stated, is the set of steps that combine inputs to produce outputs. If we've clearly identified inputs, desired outputs and necessary procedures, the steps we need to take should fall into place. Let's take the above example of averaging numbers:

- Input values
- Add values
- Output total value
- Output number of values
- Divide total value by number of values
- Output average value

When it comes to code, it's important to remember that you don't only want to implement your solution, you want to optimize your implementation. To find ways to keep your implementation simple and readable, you can use documentation to see if heavy lifting work has already been done for you. If you see that it has, but you don’t understand how to use it, test out the code and bring your new understanding to your implementation’s design.

## Translate the Procedure Description into Code
Okay. Got all that? Now ... let's code it. Take the description of the procedure you came up with and, guided by the syntax of the particular language you're working with, translate it into code. We've done so much work before this point that while the coding part might not necessarily be easy, you will at least have every advantage you could have to make it flow better for you.

## Verify the Procedure’s Output
You've got your code. It's go time. Test it out! What output did you get? If it wasn't your desired output, don't worry too much about it. Testing and revision is a natural part of the programming process. Now we have a sub-process to loop through:

- Adjust input
- Adjust implementation
- Spin-off sub-procedures
- Verify output (if necessary)
- Move from success to success, accumulating success

There's no limit on how many times you'll need to go through this verification process. Sometimes problems are complicated and you'll need to make many revisions to get the right solution. But by relying on this methodology, you'll be able to know you're still on the right track until you get there.

# Strategies for Getting Unstuck

- Simplify the problem.
Check your goal. Is it too complex? Does it try to solve multiple issues at the same time? You might be able to dismiss one or two or a few issues and solve a more straightforward version of the problem. One of the reasons adding subroutines is so powerful is because it forces the code to become simpler. This will make finding your way out a lot easier.

- Research similar problems and solutions.
The internet is your friend. Search for examples of solutions trying to achieve the same goal as yours. While you obviously don't want to cut and paste code into your own solution (not only is this not going to increase your understanding, it probably won't fit your specific needs), looking at similar problems might suggest something new to try.

- Look at the problem from a different angle.
This is an easy trap to fall into if you're working on a problem like others you've done before. You might instantly apply the same solution. But if anything is different or more complex, that same solution isn't going to work. Remember to take a step back and reconsider your assumptions about the way forward.

- Break the problem down into smaller parts.
This is similar to our first approach, simplify the problem, but it's less about the problem itself than how we're working through it. Instead of trying to fix an entire app, can you focus on a block of code? A line of code? If fighting your way through too much code at once is what's getting you stuck, you can adjust your context and take each piece one step at a time. Some developers escape this trap by starting with a clean slate and writing a simple program to do the simplest version of the task. They then "grow" their simple example's complexity until it get closer to the real problem and usually have their "A-ha!" moment in that process. This approach naturally joins to meet our following strategy as well.

- Start with a solution and solve the problem backwards.
This is the approach to take if you know exactly what your result should be but aren't sure how to get there. Start at the end and determine what it would take to get there.

- Run Uphill: Do the "Hard Thing" You Don't Want to Do.
When looking at code, we sometimes get the intuition or insight that the way the code is isn't the way it should be. Maybe the current code uses an Array and you're repeatedly doing a find() instead of a lookup (something Hashes are ideal for). In your heart of hearts, you know you should be using a Hash instead. You know you and every programmer that will come after you would wish for a Hash...but going through and changing the code to be a Hash feels like too much work and it's not really the cause of my bug so, yolo, leave the old code in. This strategy says "do the opposite." By making the code have less friction, it will free up your mind to be able to attack the bug.
