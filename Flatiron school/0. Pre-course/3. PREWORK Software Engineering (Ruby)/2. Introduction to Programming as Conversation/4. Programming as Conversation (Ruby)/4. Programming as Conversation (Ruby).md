# Collection Data Types Introduction

## Array

An Array is a collection that holds multiple pieces of data under a single name ("Gryffindors", "Countries"). In daily life, we call them "lists."
```ruby
the_beatles = [ "John Lennon", "Paul McCartney", "Ringo Starr", "George Harrison"]
```

## Hash

Another way of thinking about Arrays is that they are like tables that have an identifier that is an Integer. If we let the identifier be a String or a Symbol instead of an Integer, then we'd basically be describing a Hash.
```ruby
english_bands_by_city = {
 :liverpool =>   "The Beatles",
 :manchester =>  "The Smiths",
 :coventry =>    "Delia Derbyshire and the BBC Radiophonic Band",
 :london =>      "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars"
}
```

## Nesting of Collection Data Structures

The elements in an Array and the values in a Hash can be Hashes or Arrays themselves. This leads to "nesting" such that you could build a complex data structure like the following:
```ruby
english_music_by_city = {
  :manchester => [
    {
      :band_name => "The Smiths",
      :member_names => ["Morrissey", "Johnny", "Andy", "Mike"]
    },
    {
      :band_name => "Joy Division",
      :member_names => ["Peter", "Stephen", "Bernard", "Ian"]
    },
  ]
}
```

As a peek ahead, we can use the lookup operator ([]) to "dig into" this nested collection and get interesting information out:
```ruby
english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:band_name] #=> "The Smiths"
english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:member_names] #=> ["Morrissey", "Johnny", "Andy", "Mike"]

puts "There were #{english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:member_names].length} members in #{english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:band_name]}"
#=> "There were 4 members in The Smiths"
```

# Array Basics

## Create an Array

```ruby
# The Literal Constructor
my_array = []

# The Class Constructor
my_array = Array.new
```

To make an array that isn't empty, you can separate each item, known as an element, by a , ("comma") and wrap all the elements inside [] ("square brackets").
```ruby
puppies = ["bulldog", "terrier", "poodle"]
#=> ["bulldog", "terrier", "poodle"]

random_numbers = [ 2, 5, 6, 8, 30050]
#=> [ 2, 5, 6, 8, 30050]

mixed = ["this", "array", 7, 20, "has", 45, "integers", "&", "strings", 309]
#=> ["this", "array", 7, 20, "has", 45, "integers", "&", "strings", 309]
```

## Add Items to an Array

The Shovel Method - The shovel method employs the "shovel" operator (<<) and allows you to add ("shovel") items onto the end of an array:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats << "nala cat"

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```

The .push Method - Calling .push on an array with an argument will add that element to the end of the array. It has the same effect as the shovel method explained above:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.push("nala cat")

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```

The .unshift Method - To add an element to the front of an array, you can call the .unshift method on it with an argument of the element you wish to add:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.unshift("nala cat")

p famous_cats
#=> ["nala cat", "lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
```

## Remove Items from an Array

The .pop Method - Calling .pop on an array will remove the last item from the end of the array. The .pop method will also supply the removed element as its return:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
maru_cat = famous_cats.pop

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat"]
p maru_cat
#=> Maru
```

The .shift Method - Calling .shift on an array will remove the first item from the front of the array. The .shift method will also supply the removed element as a return:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
lil_bub = famous_cats.shift

p famous_cats
#=> ["grumpy cat", "Maru"]
p lil_bub
#=> lil' bub
```

## Retrieve Items from Array

When you write out a list on a notepad, you typically write each item on its own line. Whether or not the list is explicitly numbered, the list has a numerology to it based on the sequence of the lines that the items are listed upon.

```ruby
famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]

famous_cats[1]
#=> "Puss in Boots"

famous_cats[0]
#=> "Cheshire Cat"

famous_cats[2]
#=> "Garfield"

famous_cats[-1]
```
The "Cheshire Cat" is at index 0 in the array, "Puss in Boots" is a index 1, and "Garfield" is at index 2. Indexes will always be one less than the count. We can also access array elements by using negative index numbers. The last item of an array is considered to be stored at an index of -1.

## Identify Elements in an Array Based on Their Index Number

To discover the index number of an element within an array, we can use the .index() method. Calling .index() on an array with an argument inside the parentheses will return the first index number of an element matching that argument. If no elements match the argument, then this method will return nil.

```ruby
famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]

famous_cats.index("Puss in Boots")
#=> 1

famous_cats.index("Maru")
#=> nil
```

## Update Array Element Value Using Its Index Number

Let's imagine we have an Array, but we want to update a single value in it.
```ruby
picnic_ingredients = ["wine", "jalapeños", "donkey feed"]

picnic_ingredients[2] = "Belgian chocolate"
=> "Belgian chocolate"
```

If we now print out the Array using p we see:
```ruby
picnic_ingredients = ["wine", "jalapeños", "Belgian chocolate"]
```
