# Collection Data Types Introduction

## Array

An Array is a collection that holds multiple pieces of data under a single name ("Gryffindors", "Countries"). In daily life, we call them "lists."
```ruby
the_beatles = [ "John Lennon", "Paul McCartney", "Ringo Starr", "George Harrison"]
```

## Hash

Another way of thinking about Arrays is that they are like tables that have an identifier that is an Integer. If we let the identifier be a String or a Symbol instead of an Integer, then we'd basically be describing a Hash.
```ruby
english_bands_by_city = {
 :liverpool =>   "The Beatles",
 :manchester =>  "The Smiths",
 :coventry =>    "Delia Derbyshire and the BBC Radiophonic Band",
 :london =>      "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars"
}
```

## Nesting of Collection Data Structures

The elements in an Array and the values in a Hash can be Hashes or Arrays themselves. This leads to "nesting" such that you could build a complex data structure like the following:
```ruby
english_music_by_city = {
  :manchester => [
    {
      :band_name => "The Smiths",
      :member_names => ["Morrissey", "Johnny", "Andy", "Mike"]
    },
    {
      :band_name => "Joy Division",
      :member_names => ["Peter", "Stephen", "Bernard", "Ian"]
    },
  ]
}
```

As a peek ahead, we can use the lookup operator ([]) to "dig into" this nested collection and get interesting information out:
```ruby
english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:band_name] #=> "The Smiths"
english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:member_names] #=> ["Morrissey", "Johnny", "Andy", "Mike"]

puts "There were #{english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:member_names].length} members in #{english_music_by_city[:manchester][0][:band_name]}"
#=> "There were 4 members in The Smiths"
```

# Array Basics

## Create an Array

```ruby
# The Literal Constructor
my_array = []

# The Class Constructor
my_array = Array.new
```

To make an array that isn't empty, you can separate each item, known as an element, by a , ("comma") and wrap all the elements inside [] ("square brackets").
```ruby
puppies = ["bulldog", "terrier", "poodle"]
#=> ["bulldog", "terrier", "poodle"]

random_numbers = [ 2, 5, 6, 8, 30050]
#=> [ 2, 5, 6, 8, 30050]

mixed = ["this", "array", 7, 20, "has", 45, "integers", "&", "strings", 309]
#=> ["this", "array", 7, 20, "has", 45, "integers", "&", "strings", 309]
```

## Add Items to an Array

The Shovel Method - The shovel method employs the "shovel" operator (<<) and allows you to add ("shovel") items onto the end of an array:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats << "nala cat"

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```

The .push Method - Calling .push on an array with an argument will add that element to the end of the array. It has the same effect as the shovel method explained above:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.push("nala cat")

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```

The .unshift Method - To add an element to the front of an array, you can call the .unshift method on it with an argument of the element you wish to add:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.unshift("nala cat")

p famous_cats
#=> ["nala cat", "lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
```

## Remove Items from an Array

The .pop Method - Calling .pop on an array will remove the last item from the end of the array. The .pop method will also supply the removed element as its return:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
maru_cat = famous_cats.pop

p famous_cats
#=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat"]
p maru_cat
#=> Maru
```

The .shift Method - Calling .shift on an array will remove the first item from the front of the array. The .shift method will also supply the removed element as a return:
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
lil_bub = famous_cats.shift

p famous_cats
#=> ["grumpy cat", "Maru"]
p lil_bub
#=> lil' bub
```

## Retrieve Items from Array

When you write out a list on a notepad, you typically write each item on its own line. Whether or not the list is explicitly numbered, the list has a numerology to it based on the sequence of the lines that the items are listed upon.

```ruby
famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]

famous_cats[1]
#=> "Puss in Boots"

famous_cats[0]
#=> "Cheshire Cat"

famous_cats[2]
#=> "Garfield"

famous_cats[-1]
```
The "Cheshire Cat" is at index 0 in the array, "Puss in Boots" is a index 1, and "Garfield" is at index 2. Indexes will always be one less than the count. We can also access array elements by using negative index numbers. The last item of an array is considered to be stored at an index of -1.

## Identify Elements in an Array Based on Their Index Number

To discover the index number of an element within an array, we can use the .index() method. Calling .index() on an array with an argument inside the parentheses will return the first index number of an element matching that argument. If no elements match the argument, then this method will return nil.

```ruby
famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]

famous_cats.index("Puss in Boots")
#=> 1

famous_cats.index("Maru")
#=> nil
```

## Update Array Element Value Using Its Index Number

Let's imagine we have an Array, but we want to update a single value in it.
```ruby
picnic_ingredients = ["wine", "jalapeños", "donkey feed"]

picnic_ingredients[2] = "Belgian chocolate"
=> "Belgian chocolate"
```

If we now print out the Array using p we see:
```ruby
picnic_ingredients = ["wine", "jalapeños", "Belgian chocolate"]
```

# Array Methods

## Sort an Array

```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "maru"]
sorted_cats = famous_cats.sort
  => ["grumpy cat", "lil' bub", "maru"]
```
Because sort returns a new array, we generally store it in another variable.

If you don't need the unsorted version of the array you can call sort!. This will sort the existing array without requiring you to save the return into a new variable. The ! (called "bang") is a Ruby convention that indicates the method will do the operation in place. It will modify the receiver of the method (or the thing to the left of the dot).

## Reverse an Array

```Ruby
famous_wizards = ["Dumbledore", "Gandalf", "Merlin"]
famous_wizards.reverse
  => ["Merlin", "Gandalf", "Dumbledore"]
```
Similarly to sort!, when we call reverse! we are modifying the receiver of the method in place.


## Find the First and Last Elements of an Array

```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
famous_cats.first
  => "lil' bub"

famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
famous_cats.last
  => "Maru"
```

## Find Out If an Element Is in an Array

The .include? method will return a boolean of whether or not the array contains (or ​includes) the element submitted to it inside the parentheses.
```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
famous_cats.include?("Garfield")
  => false
famous_cats.include?("Maru")
  => true
```

## Find the Size of an Array

Sometimes we need a quick way to know how large an array is. In those cases we can use the .size method, which will return the number of elements in the array.
```ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
famous_cats.size
  => 3
```

# Array Join and String Split

## Join Elements of an Array With join to Produce a String

Since we're in a module about Arrays, let's talk about joining an Array of words.
```Ruby
["This", "is", "a", "test"].join(' ') #=> "This is a test"
["This", "is", "a", "test"].join('_') #=> "This_is_a_test"
["This", "is", "a", "test"].join('*') #=> "This*is*a*test"
```

## Create an Array of Words with Ruby's %w// Literal

Creating an Array of words can be difficult to type with all those " characters rolling about. Ruby invented an operator called the Array of Words literal.
```Ruby
%w[this is also a test] #=> ["this", "is", "also", "a", "test"]
# For method-chaining fun:
%w[this is also a test].join(" ").capitalize #=> "This is also a test"
```

## Split a String into an Array of words

If Array's join can turn an Array of Strings into one String, we can reverse the process with String's split method:
```Ruby
"When in the course of human events".split(" ") #=> ["When", "in", "the", "course", "of", "human", "events"]
```

# Array Range

## Explain Inclusive and Exclusive Range

Ruby has two operators available to generate a range of values. The inclusive two-dot (..) operator and the exclusive three-dot operator (...). The inclusive operator (..) includes both the first and last values in the range. The exclusive (...) range operator excludes the last value from the sequence. For example:
```Ruby
1..10    # Creates a range from 1 to 10 inclusive
1...10   # Creates a range from 1 to 9
```

## Generate an Array With Range

```Ruby
(1..10).to_a -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

# Looping with Arrays

## Abstracting Array Output

```Ruby
counter = 0
pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Fish", "Bird", "Hamster"]

while pets[counter] do
  puts pets[counter]
  counter += 1
end
```

We could go further than this, though, by placing our while loop in a method. Instead of just a pet printer, we can turn this code into an all purpose element printer:
```Ruby
def output_array_elements(array)
  counter = 0

  while array[counter] do
    puts array[counter]
    counter += 1
  end
end
```

Now, we could still use this for pets and get the same results. But we could also use output_array_elements with all kinds of arrays!
```Ruby
pets = ["Dog", "Cat", "Fish", "Bird", "Hamster"]
output_array_elements(pets)

output_array_elements(["hello", "how are you?", "goodbye!"])
```

## Looping Using the Array Length Method

An common alternative to the previous example is to utilize the methods built in to the Ruby Array class. Specifically, in these situations, we want to loop as many times are there are elements. To find out how many elements are in an array, we can use the length method:

```Ruby
def output_array_elements(array)
  counter = 0

  while counter < array.length do
    puts array[counter]
    counter += 1
  end
end
```

# Block Parameters

## Ruby Code Blocks

A code block is a way of grouping statements together. In the graphic above we've highlighted the code blocks. They're the part between a do...end and {...}. The code block here defines what will happen during a single iteration of our while loop. Code blocks can also be written with curly braces ({}), similar to other programming languages like JavaScript:
```Ruby
while true do
  puts 'hello'
end

while true {
  puts 'hello'
}
```

We're effectively saying to Ruby, "while this condition is true, do this." Code blocks are written immediately after a method. They can even be used in combination with methods we define, though we will most often see them used in loops and, in the near future, enumerables.

## Block Parameters

So, it turns out, we've been using code blocks already. However, there is one piece we haven't discussed: depending on the method, blocks can receive parameters that are accessible from within the block.
```ruby
5.times do |index|
  puts index
end
```

## Combining Arrays, Loops and Block Parameters

Notice that here we have to use counter, a variable defined outside the block. In the previous section, though, we were able to build a simple counting loop using only times and a block parameter. Being able to write a loop that doesn't rely on an outside variable would make this code a little bit cleaner.
```Ruby

array = [1,2,3,4,5]
length = array.length

length.times do |index|
  puts array[index]
end
```

Or, simplifying further (written here with the optional curly brace syntax):

```Ruby
array = [1,2,3,4,5]

array.length.times { |index|
  puts array[index]
}
```

# Introduction to Hashes

A hash is a collection of data that is separated into pairs of keys and values. Each key/value pair makes up one unit in the hash. The entire collection of key/value pairs, which are comma separated, is enclosed in curly braces {}:
```Ruby
{"key" => "value", "another_key" => "another value"}
```

As with Arrays, you can use white space to make it more friendly for humans to read:
```Ruby
prices = {
"bread" => 2.35,
"milk" =>  3.00,
"eggs" =>  2.15
}
```

Somewhat confusingly, Ruby has another syntax for writing Hashes that have a Symbol as key. We call Hashes defined this way "JSON (pronounced 'Jay-Sawn') Hashes."
```Ruby
{name: "John Henry", occupation: "Steel-driving Man"}
```

Hash values are the bits of data that are returned when we give a Hash a key to use to do a look up.

## Create a Hash using its implicit ("Hash-Literal") form

The easiest way to create a Hash is to write it out as we've seen in the examples so far.
```Ruby
new_hash = {
  :created => Time.now,
  :message => "Hello world!"
}
#=> {:created=>2019-04-10 14:05:33 -0400, :message=>"Hello world!"}
```

## Create a Hash with Hash.new

```Ruby
second_new_hash = Hash.new
#=> {}
# This is the same as writing:
second_new_hash = {}
#=> {}
```

# Reading Values from Hashes

## Retrieving Data from Hashes

Retrieving data from a hash is similar to retrieving data from an array, but instead of giving an array the index number in brackets [i] we give a hash the name of the key [key]. The Hash will return the value associated with the key.
```Ruby
pets = {"cat" => "Maru", "dog" => "Pluto"}
#=> {"cat"=>"Maru", "dog"=>"Pluto"}

pets["cat"]
#=> "Maru"
```

It will also work if we use Integers for keys. It is important to remember that when using the bracket method on a hash, Ruby is not looking for the index like it would in an array. Instead, Ruby is looking for the key that matches whatever is inside the brackets and returns the associated value:
```Ruby
healthy_things = {1 => "learn to garden", 2 => "plant seeds", 10 => "eat vegetables"}

healthy_things[10]
#=> "eat vegetables"
```

## Handle a nil Response When No Key Is Found

If we use the bracket notation and pass in a value that does not match a key on the hash, Ruby will return nil by default:
```Ruby
grocery_items = {:apples => 10, :pears => 4, :peaches => 2, :plums => 13}
#=> {:apples=>10, :pears=>4, :peaches=>2, :plums=>13}

grocery_items[:rambutans]
#=> nil
```

This turns out to be very useful. Remember that in Ruby, nil is falsy while any data type value is truthy (even empty arrays and hashes). This behavior allows us to easily check if a hash has a key/value pair or not as we can use the bracket method in a conditional statement:
```Ruby
grocery_items = {:apples => 10, :pears => 4, :peaches => 2, :plums => 13}
#=> {:apples=>10, :pears=>4, :peaches=>2, :plums=>13}

if grocery_items[:rambutan]
  puts "Rambutan present!"
else
  puts "No rambutan."
end
# No rambutan.
```

# Using Symbols for Hash Keys

Just to quickly review, symbols are a scalar data type. They share some similarities with strings, but instead of being wrapped in quotations, symbols always start with a colon (:):
```Ruby
:i_am_a_symbol
```
Every piece of data, including the symbol above, takes up a small amount of memory on the computer. When we write out a symbol like :i_am_a_symbol, Ruby allocates some memory to that piece of data. If we write out :i_am_a_symbol again somewhere else, Ruby will refer back to that same allocation in memory. We can actually see this by using a method built in to all core data types called object_id:
```Ruby
:i_am_a_symbol.object_id
#=> 1525788
:i_am_a_symbol.object_id
#=> 1525788
```

## Using the Alternate Hash Syntax

When using symbols for keys, we have the option of using an alternative syntax when defining a hash:
```Ruby
dog_one = {
  name: "Luca",
  breed: "German Shepherd"
}
#=> {:name=>"Luca", :breed=>"German Shepherd"}

dog_two = {
  name: "Lola",
  breed: "Giant Schnauzer"
}
#=> {:name=>"Lola", :breed=>"Giant Schnauzer"}
```

# Creating and Updating Hash Key Value Pairs

## Update Hash Values

Updating hash values is very similar to looking them up. For updating, we use the bracket-equals method:
```Ruby
person = {
  name: "Sam",
  age: 31
}
#=> {:name=>"Sam", :age=>31}

person[:age]
#=> 31

person[:age] = 32
#=> 32
```

## Add Keys and Values to a Hash

So, what happens when we use an invalid key with the bracket-equals method? When Ruby discovers that the key is not present on the hash in question, Ruby will simply create a key/value pair on the hash:
```Ruby
person = {
  name: "Sam",
  age: 31
}

# No :hometown key found
person[:hometown]
#=> nil

# Because :hometown was not present, Ruby creates the key value pair here
person[:hometown] = "Brooklyn, NY"
#=> "Brooklyn, NY"

# Now, the :hometown key refers to "Brooklyn, NY" when used in the brack method
person[:hometown]
#=> "Brooklyn, NY"

# Our original hash is also mutated
person
#=> {:name=>"Sam", :age=>31, :hometown=>"Brooklyn, NY"}
```

## Find or Create a Hash Value

```Ruby
if shipping_manifest["top hat"]
  shipping_manifest["top hat"] += 1
else
  shipping_manifest["top hat"] = 1
end
```
