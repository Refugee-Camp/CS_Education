# Variables in Ruby

```Ruby
first_number = 7
second_number = 14

sum = first_number + second_number

puts sum
```
The code above will print '21'.

```Ruby
current_president = "Barack Obama"
puts "In 2016, the president was #{current_president}."

current_president = "Barack Obama"
puts "In 2016, the president was " + current_president
```
A Ruby variable cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.

### Reassigning Variables
```Ruby
current_president = "Barack Obama"
puts "In 2016, the president was #{current_president}."

current_president = "Pavel Ilin"
puts "Now, it being the year 2017, the president is #{current_president}."
```

## Ruby Data Types

### Strings

```Ruby
"hello".size
"hello".length
   => 5
"hello".upcase
   => "HELLO"
"hello".reverse
   => "olleh"
```

### Booleans
There are only two values of the Boolean data type: true and false. In Ruby, however, there is no such thing as a Boolean class. Instead, every appearance, or instance, of true and false in your program are instances of TrueClass and FalseClass respectively.

### Numbers
```Ruby
7.5.floor
  => this method will round the float down to the nearest fixnum. Here it will return 7

7.5.ceil
  => 8
10.next
  => 11
```
### Symbols
A symbol is a representation of a piece of data. Symbols look like this :my_symbol. If I make a symbol, :my_symbol, and then use that symbol later on in my code, my program will refer to the same area of memory in both cases. This is different from, for example, strings, which take up new areas of memory every time they are used.
```Ruby
:this_is_a_symbol
```

### Arrays

```Ruby
[5, 100, 234, 7, 2].sort

  => [2, 5, 7, 100, 234]

[1, 2, 3].reverse
  => [3, 2, 1]
```

### Hashes
Hashes also store objects in Ruby. However, they differ from arrays in that they function like dictionaries.
```Ruby
{"i'm a key" => "i'm a value!", "key2" => "value2"}
```
- The Literal Constructor: You can create a hash by simply writing key/value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
- The Class Constructor: Or, you can use the Hash.new syntax, which would create an empty hash, {}.

# Array Basics

```Ruby
students = ["Harry Potter", "Ron Weasley", "Hermione Granger", "Draco Malfoy"]
```

### Creating an Array

The Literal Constructor
```Ruby
my_array = []
```
The Class Construction
```Ruby
me_array = Array.new
```

### Retrieving Items from Array

```Ruby
famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]
famous_cats[1]  #=> "Puss in Boots"

famous_cats[0] #=> "Cheshire Cat"

famous_cats[2] #=> "Garfield"

famous_cats[20] #=> nil
```

### Assigning New Values to an Array
```Ruby
speed_dial = ["Ada", "Kay", "Matz", "DHH", "Borg"]

speed_dial[1] #=> "Kay"

speed_dial[1] = "Chipps"
speed_dial[1] #=> "Chipps"
```
## Manipulating Arrays
### Adding Items to an Array
#### Shovel Method
The shovel method employs the "shovel" operator << and allows you to add ("shovel") items onto the end of an array:

```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats << "nala cat"

famous_cats #=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```

#### The .push Method
Calling .push on an array with an argument of the element you wish to add to that array, will also add that element to the end of the array. It has the same effect as the shovel method explained above. However the .push will also let you add multiple elements to an array, whereas the shovel method will only add one element.

```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.push("nala cat", 'barsik')

famous_cats #=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru", "nala cat"]
```
#### The .unshift Method
To add an element to the front of an array, you can call the .unshift method on it with an argument of the element you wish to add:

```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.unshift("nala cat")

famous_cats.inspect #=> ["nala cat", "lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
```
### Removing Items From an Array
#### The .pop Method
Calling .pop on an array will remove the last item from the end of the array. The .pop method will also supply the removed element as its return:
```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
maru_cat = famous_cats.pop

famous_cats #=> ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat"]
maru_cat #=> Maru
```
#### The .shift Method
Calling .shift on an array will remove the first item from the front of the array. The .shift method will also supply the removed element as a return:
```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]
lil_bub = famous_cats.shift

famous_cats #=> ["grumpy cat", "Maru"]
lil_bub #=> lil' bub
```

### Operating on Arrays

#### The .reverse Method
This method reverses an array.
```Ruby
famous_wizards = ["Dumbledore", "Gandalf", "Merlin"]

famous_wizards.reverse #=> ["Merlin", "Gandalf", "Dumbledore"]
```

#### The .include? Method
This method will return a boolean of whether or not the array contains (or includes) the element submitted to it inside the parentheses:
```Ruby
famous_cats = ["lil' bub", "grumpy cat", "Maru"]

famous_cats.include?("Garfield") #=> false

famous_cats.include?("Maru") #=> true
```
