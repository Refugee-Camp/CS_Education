# Booleans

Many programming languages, including Ruby, have native boolean (true or false) data types. In Ruby they're expressed directly as true and false.

Advanced: This is not the case in all languages. In Python, boolean values are capitalized, True and False, while in Objective-C they are different words YES and NO. However, they all represent the same concept of Boolean logic.

What are Boolean Operators?
Boolean operators are really methods which means that they have return values. What do they return? true or false of course!

In Ruby there are three main boolean operators:

- ! ("single-bang") which represents "NOT",
- && ("double-ampersand") which represents "AND", and
- || ("double-pipe") which represents "OR".

```Ruby
my_mood = "happy"

my_mood == "happy" #=> true

easter_eggs = 16
ducklings = 3

easter_eggs > ducklings #=> true

ducklings >= easter_eggs #=> false

ducklings == easter_eggs #=> false

# if you call class on a variable, you can see if it's a string, an integer, etc.

ducklings.class #=> Fixnum
easter_eggs.class #=> Fixnum
ducklings.class == easter_eggs.class #=> true
```

# Define Control Flow

A control flow construct is a language feature which disrupts the normal progression to the next statement and conditionally or unconditionally branches to another location in source code. –– Robert Klemme

## Implementing Control Flow
There are several ways to tell your program to conditionally execute certain code, the basic forms of which are:

- if, else, and elsif statements,
- case statements,
- loops.

### if Statements
```Ruby
if 5 > 2
  print "5 is greater than 2"
end
```

### The else Keyword
```Ruby
if false
   puts "This will never get printed because the above
     statement evaluates to false."
else
   puts "This will get printed!"
end
```

```Ruby
dog = "satisfied"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Reading newspaper."
```

### elsif Statements

```Ruby
dog = "thirsty"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
elsif dog == "thirsty"
  puts "Refilling water bowl."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Refilling water bowl."
```

```Ruby
dog = "cuddly"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "Refilling food bowl."
elsif dog == "thirsty"
  puts "Refilling water bowl."
elsif dog == "playful"
  puts "Playing tug-of-war."
elsif dog == "cuddly"
  puts "Snuggling."
else
  puts "Reading newspaper."
end

#  └── "Snuggling."
```
