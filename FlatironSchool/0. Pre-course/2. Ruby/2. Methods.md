```Ruby
def say_hello_world_ten_times
  phrase = "Hello World!"
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
  puts phrase
end

say_hello_world_ten_times
```
# String Interpolation

```Ruby
num_of_attendees = 20
puts "There are #{num_of_attendees} people coming to Beyonce's birthday party."

answer = "flamboyance"
puts "A group of flamingos is called a #{answer}."
```

### Another Way to Interpolate Variables into Strings

```Ruby
answer = "Flamboyance"
puts "A group of flamingos is called a " + answer + "."
```
Interpolation will only work on Strings wrapped in double quotes "". Single quotes: '' do not support string interpolation, so running:
```Ruby
answer = 'Flamboyance'
puts 'A group of flamingos is called a #{answer}.'
```

# Puts and Return
The primary difference between them is that puts adds a new line after executing, and print does not.
### puts and print
```Ruby
3.times { print "Hello!" }
# > Hello!Hello!Hello!

3.times { puts "Hello!" }
# > Hello!
# > Hello!
# > Hello!
```

### Returning Values
What methods like puts and print allow us to output to the console is different from Ruby's concept of a return value.
Every method in Ruby returns a value by default. This returned value will be the value of the last statement.

```Ruby
def restaurant
  restaurant_name = "Guy's American Kitchen & Bar"
  cuisine = "american"
  motto = "Welcome to Flavor Town!"
end
```
The return value of the restaurant method is "Welcome to Flavor Town!" because that was the last statement evaluated.

```Ruby
def print_name
  puts "Guy Fieri"
end
```
To both print and return your name, you could write:

```Ruby
def print_and_return_name
  puts "Guy Fieri"
  "Guy Fieri"
end
```
If you accidentally switched the order of the lines inside the method:

```Ruby
def broken_print_and_return_name
  "Guy Fieri"
  puts "Guy Fieri"
end
```
The method would instead print "Guy Fieri" and return nil. This is because the last line that was evaluated was puts ... and the return value of a puts, as seen in the table above, is always nil.

### The Return Keyword
There is one other way to return a value from a method and that is to use the return keyword.
```Ruby
def stylish_chef
  best_hairstyle = "Guy Fieri"
  return "Martha Stewart"
  "Guy Fieri"
end
```
The return keyword will disrupt the execution of your method. If you employ it, your method will return whatever you have explicitly told it to (in this case, "Martha Stewart"), and terminate.

### Why Return Values Matter
Return values are how different parts of your program communicate with one another.

# Methods and Arguments
### Understanding Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}!"
end

greeting("Sophie")
```

### Defining Method Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting_a_person(name)
  "Hello #{name}"
end
```

### Defining Methods with Multiple Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting_programmer(name, language)
  puts "Hello, #{name}. We heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

greeting_programmer("Sophie", "Ruby")
# > Hello, Sophie. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.

greeting_programmer("Steven", "Elixir")
# > Hello, Steven. We heard you are a great Elixir programmer.
```

# Default Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting(name = "Ruby programmer")
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end

greeting
# > Hello, Ruby programmer!

greeting("Sophie")
# > Hello, Sophie!
```
In our argument list, (name = "Ruby programmer"), we simply assign the argument name a default value of "Ruby programmer". By doing so, we are really saying:

If the method is invoked without any arguments, i.e. like this: greeting, Ruby will assume the value of the name variable inside the method to be "Ruby programmer".

However, if the method is invoked with an argument, greeting("Sophie"), Ruby will assign the variable name to the string "Sophie" inside the method.

### Adding Default Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting(name="Ruby programmer", language="Ruby")
  puts "Hello, #{name}. We heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

greeting
# > Hello, Ruby programmer. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.

greeting("Sophie")
# > Hello, Sophie. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.

greeting("Steven", "Elixir")
# > Hello, Steven. We heard you are a great Elixir programmer.
```

### Using Default Argument and Required Arguments

```Ruby
def greeting(name, language="Ruby")
  puts "Hello, #{name}. We heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

greeting("Sophie", "Ember.js")
# > Hello, Sophie. We heard you are a great Ember.js programmer.

greeting("Dan")
# > Hello, Dan. We heard you are a great Ruby programmer.
```
