# Introduction to Enumerables

## "Character of Enumerable Methods"

"Enumerate" comes from the Latin root words that mean "according to the number." Ruby "visits" each element or pair "according to the number" of elements or pairs present in the collection. The essential character of all Enumerable methods or "Enumerables" is:

- Given a collection
- Based on the number, visit each one by its number in the series (Latin: ex numero, the source of "enumerate")
- Do some "work" or "test" the elements or pairs in the collection
THEN:
- Accumulate those elements-after-work-was-applied into a new collection
- OR, determine some special value like: maximum, minimum, true if all values were truthy, true if any value was truthy, true if no values were truthy, etc.

## Pseudocode a Real-World Use of Enumerables

PSEUDOCODE: Below we're going to use "pseudocode." It's something that looks a bit like code, but we're not expecting that it would run, it's just a convenient way to express a problem's solution in a way like code, but far less demanding. It's common to find programmers "sketching" a problem or a phenomenon in pseudocode because it's usually shorter to write than English and, once you learn programming, it's a handy way to communicate with other programmers.
```Ruby
while on_the_train
  if i_hear_a_sick_sound
    my_mask_status = true
  end
end
```
If we were to encode this, we might write the (real code, not pseudocode) the method as:
```Ruby
def i_hear_a_sick_sound(passengers_sounds)
  i = 0 # set up a i for the enumeration of the passengers collection
  while i < passengers_sounds.length do # a loop for each passenger
    # Stop enumerating and return true if any passenger is
    # coughing or sneezing
    if (passengers_sounds[i] == "coughing" || passengers_sounds[i] == "sneezing")
      return true
    end
    i += 1
  end
  return false
end

i_hear_a_sick_sound(["coughing", "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) #=> true
i_hear_a_sick_sound(["sneezing", "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) #=> true
i_hear_a_sick_sound([            "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) #=> false
```

## Define map

As mentioned in the "Character of Enumerables," we need to visit each member of a collection. This is common to all Enumerable methods. In the case of map, we're going to produce a new Array after "transforming" or applying "work" to each element. An example would be "multiply each number in this Array [1,2,3] by -1, returning a new Array of the input Array "negative-ized."

Grand Result = [-1, -2, -3]

## Define reduce

As mentioned in the "Character of Enumerables," we need to visit each member of a collection. This is common to all Enumerable methods. In the case of reduce, we're going to accumulate the results of the "work" to produce a new, single value. An example would be "sum up an Array of numbers." You combine each element into the new aggregate total by updating the aggregate by using an expression like total = total + current_element. This updating an aggregator value and returning it at the end is the essence of reduce.
Here's a tabular representation of reduce-ing an Array of [1, 2, 3] with a starting point of 0.
Grand Result = 6

## Pass a Block to a Method

We pass a block to a method by including either a {} or a do...end block after our call to the method.
```Ruby
method_using_block { puts "hi" }

# Is the same as...
method_using_block do
  puts "hi"
end
```

## Purpose of the yield Keyword

The yield keyword executes the block passed into the method. When it is executed, it can be passed arguments. You could pass it local variables that were defined within the method that is, in turn, executing the block.
```Ruby
def make_sandwich(element1, element2)
  base = "A #{element1} and #{element2}"
  puts base
  yield
  base
end

make_sandwich("chicken", "a sense of malaise") do |innards|
  puts "making some tasty stuff..."
end #=> "A chicken and a sense of malaise"
```

## Pass Data Between Methods and Blocks

In the same way that you provide parameters in methods in order to "catch" things passed in, we define _block-parameters_ by placing their name(s) between a pair of "pipe" characters (|), separated by commas (,). Then, within the block, we can use the passed-in data in whatever way we deem fit.
```Ruby
def make_sandwich(element1, element2)
  base = "A #{element1} and #{element2}"
  yield(base)
end

make_sandwich("gator", "gumbo") do |innards|
  "#{innards} on rye"
end #=> "A gator and gumbo on rye"
```

Since this is a simple transformation, we'll convert to a {}-based block. We'll also rewrite the internals of make_sandwich to be a bit cleaner.
```Ruby
def make_sandwich(element1, element2)
  yield("A #{element1} and #{element2} sandwich")
end

make_sandwich("grits", "abject terror") { |innards| "#{innards} on rye" }
#=> "A grits and abject terror sandwich on rye"
```

## Use map to Transform an Array

```Ruby
[10, 20, 30, 40].map{ |num| num * 2 } #=> [20, 40, 60, 80]
```

## Use reduce to Reduce an Array to a Value

```Ruby
[10, 20, 30, 40].reduce(0){ |total, num| total + num } #=> 100
[10, 20, 30, 40].reduce(100){ |total, num| total + num } #=> 200
```

## Select / Reject

```Ruby
[10, 20, 30, 40].select{ |num| num > 25 } #=> [30, 40]
[10, 20, 30, 40].reject{ |num| num > 25 } #=> [10, 20]
```

- Map a collection
- Only accumulate the elements that make a truthy expression in the block for select. Ruby also lets you do this work by calling the method filter, which operates the same way.
- Only accumulate the elements that don't make a truthy expression in the block for reject.

## List of Enumerables to Memorize
- map: create a new Array after transforming each element
- reduce: extract a value after joining elements together
- all?: Everything "tested" by the block returns truthy
- any?: Did anything "tested" by the block returns truthy
- collect: A synonym for map
- count: Which elements satisfy the block or, without block, how many elements are there?
- detect: Which element satisfies the block first. Does the same thing as find.
- find_all: Which elements satisfy the block?
- find_index: What is the index of the first element to satisfy the block?
- max: What's the highest value?
- max_by: What's the highest value based on some property of the element?
- min: What's the lowest value?
- sort: Put the values in order

## Use each to Work with an Array

The best time to use each is when you need to enumerate a collection but aren't transforming data. It's also great to use when you're not quite sure which Enumerable you want to use. The times when you're not better off map-ping or reduce-ing are few. The best use is to print out something to the screen:
```Ruby
oppressed_workers = ["Dopey", "Sneezy", "Happy", "Angry", "Doc", "Lemonjello", "Sleepy" ]
oppressed_workers.each do |oppressed_worker|
  puts "#{oppressed_worker.capitalize} wants to start a union!"
end
```

## List each Variants

The each method has a few close cousins that follow the "Character of Enumerable Methods." You want to recognize them, but you needn't memorize them. Consult the [Enumerables][enumdoc] documentation to see how the following work:

- each_cons
- each_entry
- each_slice
- each_with_index
- each_with_object (a cousin of reduce)

# Hashes and Enumerables

## Use each and each_pair to Print Out a Hash

For a simple exercise that each is perfect for, let's print out each pair:
```Ruby
bands.each{ |pair| p pair } #=>
# [:joy_division, ["ian", "bernard", "peter", "stephen"]]
# [:the_smiths, ["johnny", "andy", "morrissey", "mike"]]
# [:the_cramps, ["lux", "ivy", "nick"]]
# [:blondie, ["debbie", "chris", "clem", "jimmy", "nigel"]]
# [:talking_heads, ["david", "tina", "chris", "jerry"]]
```

## Use reduce to Create a Transformed Hash

Let's put all our bands' members' names in order and print the original and sorted Hashes.
```Ruby
bands = {
  joy_division: %w[ian bernard peter stephen],
  the_smiths: %w[johnny andy morrissey mike],
  the_cramps: %w[lux ivy nick],
  blondie: %w[debbie chris clem jimmy nigel],
  talking_heads: %w[david tina chris jerry]
}

bands.reduce({}) do |memo, pair|
  p memo # First block parameter
  p pair # Second block parameter
  memo # Return value for the block. It becomes the memo in the next go-round
end
{}
[:joy_division, ["ian", "bernard", "peter", "stephen"]]
{}
[:the_smiths, ["johnny", "andy", "morrissey", "mike"]]
{}
[:the_cramps, ["lux", "ivy", "nick"]]
{}
[:blondie, ["debbie", "chris", "clem", "jimmy", "nigel"]]
{}
[:talking_heads, ["david", "tina", "chris", "jerry"]]
```

## Use reduce to Resolve a Value From a Hash

With Hashes, we also use reduce to accumulate to a single value. Let's find first-most alphabetical band member of the entire Hash
```Ruby
bands = {
  joy_division: %w[ian bernard peter stephen],
  the_smiths: %w[johnny andy morrissey mike],
  the_cramps: %w[lux ivy nick],
  blondie: %w[debbie chris clem jimmy nigel],
  talking_heads: %w[david tina chris jerry]
}

firstmost_name = bands.reduce(nil) do |memo, (key, value)|
  # On the first pass, we don't have a name, so just grab the first one.
  memo = value[0] if !memo

  # Sort that array of names
  sorted_names = value.sort

  # If string comparison says the sorted name of the array is earlier than
  # the memo, it becomes the new memo.
  memo = sorted_names[0] if sorted_names[0] <= memo

  # Return the memo as per reduce rules
  # (Try adding 'p' in front of memo to see how it changes as the enumerate the
  # pair of the hash!)
  memo
end
p firstmost_name
```
