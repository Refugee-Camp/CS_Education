Diagram showing the four regions of a Venn Diagram for Categorical Statements Image

Region 1 represents things that are A, but not B. 

Region 2 represents things that are both A and B. 

Region 3 represents things that are B, but not A. 

Region 4 (the area outside the circles) represents everything that is neither A nor B.

 
## The 'I' Statement

A particular statement is only true when its terms refer to one or more actually existing things.

Diagram showing the Venn Diagram for categorical I statements Image

All the aardvarks in the universe rounded up and rooting around for ants inside the first circle—the A circle. Likewise, imagine all the mammals in the universe collected and resting inside the second circle—the M circle. The X indicates that there is at least one thing existing in the part of the aardvark region that overlaps with the mammal region. That is, some aardvarks are mammals. Notice that we did not put an X in region 3. Independent of the diagram, we might know that there are creatures in region 3—there are mammals that are not aardvarks—but the I statement does not tell us this, and we wish to diagram only the information the statement gives, and nothing more. Region 3 therefore gets no X.

 

## The 'O' Statement

O sentence “Some cats are not pets”:

Region 1 represents things that are cats but not pets, region 2 represents cats that are pets, and region 3 represents pets that are not cats. The X tells us there is at least one thing “inside” area 1.

 

## The 'A' Statement

A statement “All cats are mammals,” looks like this:

Here we shade region 1 to represent an empty set. Namely there are no cats that are not mammals -- that category is "empty" because our A statement tells us that everything that is a cat is also a mammal.

 

## The 'E' Statement 

E statement understood as asserting, “Nothing is a cat and a mammal,” or “No cats are mammals.” The Venn diagram looks like this:

In this diagram, we shade only region 2 or the area that overlaps both cats and mammals. We do not shade region 3 because we're not making any claims about the entire class of mammals. Our E statement only tells us that if something is a cat it is not a mammal. So that category is null or empty.

Area 1: Anything here is an M, but not an S, and not a P.

Area 2: Anything here is an S and an M, but not a P.

Area 3: Anything here is an S, a P, and an M. 

Area 4: Anything here is a P and an M, but not an S. 

Area 5: Anything here is an S, but not an M and not a P. 

Area 6: Anything here is an S and a P, but not an M. 

Area 7: Anything here is a P, but not an S, and not an M. 

Area 8: Things out here would be neither P, S, nor M.
