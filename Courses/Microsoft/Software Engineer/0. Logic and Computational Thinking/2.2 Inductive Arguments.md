# Inductive argument
intend to show that conclusion is probably or likely true even if all premises are true. 
 

Example:

The Rolling Stones have sold out every concert theyâ€™ve given over the past fifty years.

Therefore, it is quite probable that their next concert will sell out

 

Indicator words: probably, likely, and it is reasonable to conclude.

 

Inductive argument form are either strong or weak. Validity can't apply to inductive arguments. Determine strength of arguments less formal and more subjective in case of inductive arguments. It more based on judgment and background knowledge and experience rather then rules. We can use Bayes' Theorem to help to determine strength of arguments.

 

### Strong example:

All meteorites found to this day have contained gold

Therefore, probably the next meteorite found will contain gold

 

### Weak example:

This barrel contains one hundred apples

Three apples selected at random were found to be ripe

Therefore, probably all one hundred apples are ripe

 

## Cogency
strong inductive arguments with true premises are considered cogent.

 

Example:

It has rained over 20 inches per year in Seattle for last 20 years.

It will rain in Seattle again this year

Therefore it probably will rain over 20 inches over the course of the year.

 

## Modal Modifiers
using terms "necessary" or "impossible" we will decrease the strength of an inductive argument.
