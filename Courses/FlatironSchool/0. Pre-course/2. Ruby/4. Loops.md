Loops, allow us to tell our program to do the same thing over and over with just a few simple, clear, and easy to understand lines.

```Ruby
10.times do
  puts "Hi! Welcome to my very repetitive program"
end
```

## The loop Keyword
The first looping construct that we'll discuss is loop. This is the simplest looping construct that we have in Ruby. It simply executes a block (the code that is between the do and end keywords).
```Ruby
loop do
  puts "I have found the Time Machine!"
end
```

## Stopping Loops with Break and Counters

```Ruby
loop do
  puts "You'll see this exactly once."
  break # Exit the Loop
end
```

```Ruby
counter = 0 # Start our counter at 0, we have never run the loop
loop do # Start our loop
  # increment our counter by 1 and set it equal to the sum of its current value, plus 1.
  counter = counter + 1

  # Do Something
  puts "Iteration #{counter} of the loop"

  if counter >= 10 # If our counter is 10 or more
    break # Stop the loop
  end
end
```

## while
The while construct is a little different from the loop construct that we looked at earlier. The while construct will keep executing a block as long as a specific condition is true.
```Ruby
counter = 0
while counter < 20
  puts "The current number is less than 20."
  counter += 1
end
```

```Ruby
num_of_hotdogs_eaten = 0
# => 0 (return value)

while num_of_hotdogs_eaten < 7
  num_of_hotdogs_eaten += 1
  puts "You have now eaten #{num_of_hotdogs_eaten} hot dog(s)."
end
# => nil (return value)

puts "You ate a total of #{num_of_hotdogs_eaten} hot dogs!"
````
## until
Until is simply the inverse of a while loop. An until keyword will keep executing a block until a specific condition is true. In other words, the block of code following until will execute while the condition is false. One helpful way to think about it is to read until as "if not".
```Ruby
counter = 0
until counter == 20
  puts "The current number is less than 20."
  counter += 1
end
```
