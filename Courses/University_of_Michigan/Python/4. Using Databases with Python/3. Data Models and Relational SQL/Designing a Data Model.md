## Building a Data Model

Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships

Basic Rule: Don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead

When there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database

### For each "piece of info"

- Is the column an object or an attribute of another object?
- Once we define objects, we need to define the relationships between objects
