## Object Oriented

- A program is made up of many cooperating objects
- Instead of being the "whole program" - each object is a little "island" within the program and cooperatively working with other objects
- A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use if each other's capabilities

## Object

- Is a bit of self-contained code and data
- A key aspect of the object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts
- Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
- We have been using objects all along: String objects, integer objects, dictionary objects, list objects

## Definitions

- Class - a template (concept of dog is class, particular dog ins object)
- Method or message - a defined capability of a class
- Attribute or Field  - a bit of data in a class
- Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class

```python
x = 'abc'
type(x)
# class 'string'
# x is an object of class 'string'
```
