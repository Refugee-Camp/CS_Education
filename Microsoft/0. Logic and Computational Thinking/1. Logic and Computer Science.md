# Formal Logic and Computer Science

## Logic: A Brief Introduction

Logic it's a science (like a law of nature) about how think well. 

## What is a Turing Machine?

Turing Machine - theoretical machine which you binary code 1 and 0, two different state. All computer is exactly Turing machine, the only difference is the scale. Computers contain lots of 1 and 0 switches which make possible all that computers does. Turing discover was that we can use different combination of switches we can represent just about anything.

## Bits and Bytes

Bit - one of the states 0 and 1. Bit can be 0 or 1 at any given time but has the potential to be ether at other given time.

Byte - single unit of information, which is contain combinations of 8 bits.

When we press letter A keyboard send signal to CPU which translate signal into a Byte (8 bits, 8 digits), after CPU compute this signal it send another signal to screen to print letter A.

## Algorithms 

Algorithm is a repeatable set of steps that can take inputs and that produce a predictable, consistent output.

## Logic and Computer Science

Using syllogisms we can write precise instruction for computers what we want them to do.
