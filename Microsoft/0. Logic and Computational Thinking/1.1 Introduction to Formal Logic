# Arguments

Object of logic study is arguments. Arguments it's a way we structure our thinking.

Structure of argument:

1) Premises: the reason or evidence cited

2) Conclusion: the statement being proved by premises

3) Logical relation: the logical connection from premises to conclusion

Logical relation most important in structure of arguments. If we don't have logical relation or it falls all the argument doesn't have any meaning.

## Statements

Premises or conclusion it's a declarative statement. All statements attempt to declare truth (not all of them is really true) and that's why only declarative statements qualify as a statement in logic.

Types of statements:

Questions or interrogative: "What time is it?"

Commands or imperative: "Close the door!"

Exclamations or exclamatory: "Ouch!"

Performatives: "I promise" or "I thee wed"

Declaratives: "Carbon is an element"

 
Simple statement: declare only one situation or state of affairs is true.

Example - Ann is home.

Compound statement: Contain more then one simple statements which connects by statements operators.

Example - Ann is home AND Bob is home.

## Propositions
 
Proposition is a meaning, premises and conclusions (statements) it's a symbols of this meaning. You can express same proposition using different symbols. 

Example - number 2 it's a proposition, numeral 2 it's representation or symbolization of number 2.


Philosopher Peter van Inwagen defines a proposition as a "non-linguistic bearer of truth value".

### Examples:

 -Pat likes Jan

 - Jan is liked by Pat


The moon has craters

La luna tiene cr√°teres

 
The epistemic position of the defense side of the litigation lacks justificatory veracity.

The defendant failed to make her case.

 
As we can see different statements (symbols) represent the same proposition (meaning). Even if we use statements from different languages, proposition is stays the same.
 
## Truth Value

Proposition can be true or false It can't be neither or can't be both, but not the statements cause it's just a symbol of proposition. 

Many proposition can be true at one time and false at another. And some always true and always false.
