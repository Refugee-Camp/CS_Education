# Section 1: Importing and Summarizing Data

## Read and explore your data

- Import pandas as pd.
- Read in the data from recent_grads_url (which is a CSV file) and assign it to a variable called recent_grads.
- Print the shape of recent_grads.

```python
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Use pandas to read in recent_grads_url
recent_grads = pd.read_csv(recent_grads_url)

# Print the shape
print(recent_grads.shape)
```

## Exploring Your Data

- Print the .dtypes of your data so that you know what each column contains.
- Output basic summary statistics using a single pandas function.
- With the same function from before, summary statistics for all columns that aren't of type object.

```python
# Print .dtypes
print(recent_grads.dtypes)

# Output summary statistics
print(recent_grads.describe())

# Exclude data of type object
print(recent_grads.describe(exclude=['object']))
```

## Replacing Missing Values

- Look at the dtypes of the columns in columns to make sure that the data is numeric.
- It looks like a string is being used to encode missing values. Use the .unique() method to figure out what the string is.
- Search for missing values in the median, p25th, and p75th columns.
- Replace the found missing values with a NaN value, using numpy's np.nan.

```python
# Names of the columns we're searching for missing values
columns = ['median', 'p25th', 'p75th']

# Take a look at the dtypes
print(recent_grads[columns].dtypes)

# Find how missing values are represented
print(recent_grads["median"].unique())

# Replace missing values with NaN
for column in columns:
    recent_grads.loc[recent_grads[column] == 'UN', column] = np.nan
```

## Select a Column

- Select the sharewomen column from recent_grads and assign this to a variable named sw_col.
- Output the first 5 rows of sw_col.

```python
# Select sharewomen column
sw_col = recent_grads['sharewomen']

# Output first five rows
print(sw_col.loc[0:4])
```

## Column Maximum Value

- Import numpy as np.
- Using a numpy built-in function, find the maximum value of the sharewomen column and assign this value to the variable max_sw.
- Print the value of max_sw

```python
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Use max to output maximum values
max_sw = max(sw_col)

# Print column max
print(max_sw)
```

## Selecting a Row

- Output the row of data for the department that has the largest percentage of women.

```python
# Output the row containing the maximum percentage of women
print(recent_grads[sw_col == max_sw])
```

## Converting a DataFrame to Numpy Array

- Select the columns unemployed and low_wage_jobs from recent_grads, then convert them to a numpy array. Save this as recent_grads_np.
- Print the type of recent_grads_np to see that it is a numpy array.

```python
# Convert to numpy array
recent_grads_np = recent_grads[["unemployed", "low_wage_jobs"]].values

# Print the type of recent_grads_np
print(type(recent_grads_np))
```

## Correlation Coefficient

- Calculate the correlation matrix of the numpy array recent_grads_np.

```python
print(np.corrcoef(recent_grads_np[:,0], recent_grads_np[:,1]))
```

# Section 2: Manipulating Data

## Creating Columns I

- Create a new column named sharemen, that contains the percentage of men for a given department by dividing the number of men by the total number of students for each department.

```python
# Add sharemen column
recent_grads['sharemen'] = recent_grads['men'] / recent_grads['total']
```

## Select Row with Highest Value

- Using numpy, find the maximum value for the percentage of men and call this variable max_men.
- Select the row that has the percentage of men which corresponds to max_men.

```python
# Find the maximum percentage value of men
max_men = np.max(recent_grads['sharemen'])

# Output the row with the highest percentage of men
print(recent_grads[recent_grads['sharemen'] == max_men])
```

## Creating columns II

- Add a column named gender_diff that reports how much higher the rate of women is than the rate of men.

```python
# Add gender_diff column
recent_grads['gender_diff'] = recent_grads['sharewomen'] - recent_grads['sharemen']
```

## Updating columns

- Use numpy and pandas to convert each value in the gender_diff column to its absolute value.
- Output the five departments with the most balanced gender ratios.

```python
# Make all gender difference values positive
recent_grads['gender_diff'] = np.abs(recent_grads['gender_diff'])

# Find the 5 rows with lowest gender rate difference
print(recent_grads.nsmallest(5, 'gender_diff'))
```

## Filtering rows

- Create diff_30, a boolean Series that is True when the corresponding value of gender_diff is greater than 0.30 and False otherwise.
- Make another boolean Series called more_men that's true when the corresponding row in recent_grads has more men than women.
- Combine your two Series to make one that you can use to select rows that have both more men than women and a value of gender_diff greater than 0.30. Save the result as more_men_and_diff_30.
- Use this new boolean Series to create the DataFrame fewer_women that contains only the rows you're interested in.

```python
# Rows where gender rate difference is greater than .30
diff_30 = recent_grads['gender_diff'] > .30

# Rows with more men
more_men = recent_grads['sharemen'] > recent_grads['sharewomen']

# Combine more_men and diff_30
more_men_and_diff_30 = np.logical_and(more_men, diff_30)

# Find rows with more men and and gender rate difference greater than .30
fewer_women = recent_grads[more_men_and_diff_30]
```

## Grouping with Counts

- Using the .groupby() method, group the recent_grads DataFrame by 'major_category' and then count the number of departments per category using .count().

```python
# Group by major category and count
print(recent_grads.groupby(['major_category']).major_category.count())
```

## Grouping with Counts, Part 2

- Create a DataFrame that groups the departments by major category and shows the number of departments that are skewed in women.

```python
# Group departments that have less women by category and count
print(fewer_women.groupby(['major_category']).major_category.count())
```

## Grouping One Column with Means

- Write code that outputs the average gender percentage difference by major category.

```python
# Report average gender difference by major category
print(recent_grads.groupby(['major_category']).gender_diff.mean())
```

## Grouping Two Columns with Means

- Write a query that outputs the mean number of 'low_wage_jobs' and average 'unemployment_rate' grouped by 'major_category'.

```python
# Find average number of low wage jobs and unemployment rate of each major category
dept_stats = recent_grads.groupby(['major_category'])['low_wage_jobs', 'unemployment_rate'].mean()
print(dept_stats)
```

# Section 3: Visualizing Data

## Plotting Scatterplots

- Import matplotlib.pyplot with the alias plt.
- Create a scatter plot between unemployment_rate and low_wage_jobs per major category.
- Label the x axis with 'Unemployment rate'.
- Label the y axis with 'Low pay jobs'.

```python
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(unemployment_rate, low_wage_jobs)

# Label x axis
plt.xlabel('Unemployment rate')

# Label y axis
plt.ylabel('Low pay jobs')

# Display the graph
plt.show()
```

## Modifying Plot Colors

- Create the scatterplot visualization between the unemployment rate and number of low wage jobs per major category using the .plot() method.
- Customize this scatterplot so that the points are red triangles by setting the color argument to "r" and the marker argument ^.
- Display the plot you've created!

```python
# Plot the red and triangle shaped scatter plot  
plt.scatter(unemployment_rate, low_wage_jobs, color = "r", marker = "^")

# Display the visualization
plt.show()
```

## Plotting Histograms

- Use matplotlib to create a histogram of sharewomen.
- Show the plot you created.

```python
# Plot a histogram of sharewomen
plt.hist(sharewomen)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Plotting with pandas

- Use the .plot() method with kind='scatter' on the dept_stats DataFrame to create a scatter plot with 'unemployment_rate' on the x-axis and 'low_wage_jobs' on the y-axis.

```python
# Import matplotlib and pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create scatter plot
dept_stats.plot(kind='scatter', x='unemployment_rate', y='low_wage_jobs')
plt.show()
```

## Plotting Two Bar Graphs

- Use pandas to create a DataFrame that reports the number of graduates working at jobs that do require college degrees ('college_jobs'), and do not require college degrees ('non_college_jobs'). Assign this to a variable named df1.
- Create a plot that reports this data with matplotlib.
- Display the plot you've created!

```python
# DataFrame of college and non-college job sums
df1 = recent_grads.groupby(['major_category'])['college_jobs','non_college_jobs'].sum()

# Plot bar chart
df1.plot(kind="bar")

# Show graph
plt.show()
```

## Dropping Missing Values

- With a single line of code, drop all the rows that have a missing value.
- Print the size of the manipulated DataFrame.

```python
# Print the size of the DataFrame
print(recent_grads.size)

# Drop all rows with a missing value
recent_grads.dropna(axis = 0, inplace = True)

# Print the size of the DataFrame
print(recent_grads.size)
```

## Plotting Quantiles of Salary, Part 1

- The columns median, p25th, and p75th are currently encoded as strings. Convert these columns to numerical values. Then, divide the value of each column by 1000 to make the scale of the final plot easier to read.
- Find the of each of the three columns for each major category. Save this as sal_quantiles

```python
# Convert to numeric and divide by 1000
recent_grads['median'] = pd.to_numeric(recent_grads['median']) / 1000
recent_grads['p25th'] = pd.to_numeric(recent_grads['p25th']) / 1000
recent_grads['p75th'] = pd.to_numeric(recent_grads['p75th']) / 1000

# Select averages by major category
columns = ['median', 'p25th', 'p75th']
sal_quantiles = recent_grads.groupby(['major_category'])[columns].mean()
```

## Plotting Quantiles of Salary, Part 2

- Plot the DataFrame.
- Clean up the x-axis labels with the function plt.xticks(). Set the first argument equal to np.arange(len(sal_quantiles.index)), the second argument equal to sal_quantiles.index, and the keyword argument rotation = 'vertical'.
- Show the plot.
- Now call the .plot() method with the argument subplots=True to plot the columns on separate axes. Show this plot as well.

```python
# Plot the data
sal_quantiles.plot()

# Set xticks
plt.xticks(
    np.arange(len(sal_quantiles.index)),
    sal_quantiles.index,
    rotation='vertical')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Plot with subplots
sal_quantiles.plot(subplots=True)
plt.show()
```
