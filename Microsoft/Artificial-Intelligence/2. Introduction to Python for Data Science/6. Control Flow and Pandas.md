# Boolean Logic & Control Flow

## Equality

- In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
- Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
- Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
- What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.


```Python
# Comparison of booleans
print(True == False)

# Comparison of integers
print(-5 * 15 != 75)

# Comparison of strings
print('pyscript' == 'PyScript')

# Compare a boolean with an integer
print(True == 1)
```

## Greater and less than

- x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
- "test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been deinfed for you.
- True is greater than False.

```Python
# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(x >= -10)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print('test' <= y)

# Comparison of booleans
print(True > False)
```

## and, or, not (1)

- my_kitchen is bigger than 10 and smaller than 18.
- my_kitchen is smaller than 14 or bigger than 17.
- double the area of my_kitchen is smaller than triple the area of your_kitchen.

```Python
# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print(my_kitchen * 2 < your_kitchen * 3)
```

# Pandas

## CSV to DataFrame (1)

- To import CSV files, you still need the pandas package: import it as pd.
- Use pd.read_csv() to import cars.csv data as a DataFrame. Store this dataframe as cars.
- Print out cars. Does everything look OK?

```Python
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Import the cars.csv data: cars
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')

# Print out cars
print(cars)
```

## CSV to DataFrame (2)

- Run the code with Submit Answer and assert that the first column should actually be used as row labels.
- Specify the index_col argument inside pd.read_csv(): set it to 0, so that the first column is used as row labels.
- Has the printout of cars improved now?

```Python
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Fix import by including index_col
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col=0)

# Print out cars
print(cars)
```

## Square Brackets

- Use single square brackets to print out the country column of cars as a Pandas Series.
- Use double square brackets to print out the country column of cars as a Pandas DataFrame. Do this by putting country in two square brackets this time.

```Python
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out country column as Pandas Series
print(cars['country'])

# Print out country column as Pandas DataFrame
print(cars[['country']])
```

## loc (1)

- Use loc to select the observation corresponding to Japan as a Series. The label of this row is JAP. Make sure to print the resulting Series.
- Use loc to select the observations for Australia and Egypt as a DataFrame. You can find out about the labels of these rows by inspecting cars in the IPython Shell. Make sure to print the resulting DataFrame.

```Python
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.loc[['JAP']])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS', 'EG']])
```

## loc (2)

- Print out the drives_right value of the row corresponding to Morocco (its row label is MOR)
- Print out a sub-DataFrame, containing the observations for Russia and Morocco and the columns country and drives_right.

```Python
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

print(cars)

# Print out drives_right value of Morocco
print(cars.loc[['RU', 'MOR'], ['country', 'drives_right']])

# Print sub-DataFrame
print(cars.loc[['MOR', 'RU'], ['country', 'drives_right']])
```
