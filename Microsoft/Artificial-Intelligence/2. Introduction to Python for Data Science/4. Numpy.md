# Lab: 2D Numpy Arrays

### Your First 2D Numpy Array
- Use np.array() to create a 2D Numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
- Print out the type of np_baseball.
- Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball. Use np_baseball.shape.
```python
# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
```

### Baseball data in 2D form
- Use np.array() to create a 2D Numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
- Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball.

```python
# Create baseball, a list of lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)
```

### Subsetting 2D Numpy Arrays
- Print out the 50th row of np_baseball.
- Make a new variable, np_weight, containing the entire second column of np_baseball.
- Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in np_baseball and print it out.

```python
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight
np_weight = np_baseball[:,1]
```

### 2D Arithmetic
- You managed to get hold on the changes in weight, height and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D Numpy array, update. Add np_baseball and update and print out the result.
- You want to convert the units of height and weight. As a first step, create a Numpy array with three values: 0.0254, 0.453592 and 1. Name this array conversion.
- Multiply np_baseball with conversion and print out the result.

```python
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# update is available as 2D Numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and update
print(np_baseball + update)

# Create Numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])
```

# Basic Statistics with Numpy

### Average versus median
- Create Numpy array np_height, that is equal to first column of np_baseball.
- Print out the mean of np_height.
- Print out the median of np_height.

```python
# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height from np_baseball
np_height = np.array(np_baseball[:,0])

# Print out the mean of np_height
print(np.mean(np_height))

# Print out the median of np_height
print(np.median(np_height))
```

### Explore the baseball data
- The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace None with the correct code.
- Use np.std() on the first column of np_baseball to calculate stddev. Replace None with the correct code.
- Do big players tend to be heavier? Use np.corrcoef() to store the correlation between the first and second column of np_baseball in corr. Replace None with the correct code.

```python
# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0], np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))
```

### Blend it all together

- Convert heights and positions, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them np_heights and np_positions.
- Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use np_positions == 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to gk_heights.
- Extract all the heights of the all the other players. This time use np_positions != 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to other_heights.
- Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using np.median(). Replace None with the correct code.
- Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code.

```python
# heights and positions are available as lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_positions = np.array(positions)
np_heights = np.array(heights)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights = np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
```
