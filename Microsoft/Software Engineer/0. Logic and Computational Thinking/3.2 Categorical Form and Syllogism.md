## Standard form

Standard form can't contain adjectives, only noun which is must denotes a class or category of things.

 

## Quantifiers

Sometimes we have to restate a sentence to include a quantifier to make it formally correct and more clear and specific.

Nonstandard - A tiger is a mammal.

Standard - All tigers are mammals.

 

The "some" quantifier can be even trickier because there are many words people use to denote "at least one." As a rule, any quantity less than all is best translated as some:

 

Nonstandard - Most cats are cute.

Standard - Some cats are cute animals.

 

## Copulas

In standard form only copulas allowed "are" or "are not".

 

 

## The Categorical Syllogism

Categorical syllogisms are composed only of categorical statements
Each sentence in the argument contains exactly two termsâ€”no more, no less.
The argument as a whole contains exactly three different terms, each appearing exactly twice in the argument.
No term appears twice in the same sentence.
 

Middle term - term appears in both premises.

Major term - predicate of the conclusion.

Minor term - term appears as the subject of the conclusion.

Major premise - premise which contain major term.

Minor premise - premise contain minor term.

 

A categorical syllogism is in standard form if the major premise is listed first, followed by the minor premise, and finally the conclusion.
