# Levels of expertise
The Dreyfus brothers break each level down by four criteria which help us to understand each level better.

# The Novice Stage

The novice stage is the first level of skill acquisition, where you are just getting started in the skill and have little familiarity with it.

The defining element of the novice is a reliance on recipes. Novices need clear instructions on how to do something in order to do it. They don’t have an intuitive understanding of the skill, so they need someone else’s recipes to follow in order to complete any task within the skill.

### Context: None
Novices have no context for why they’re doing anything. You can tell them to add more sugar or salt to a recipe, but they don’t know what that is going to do or why that’s the right decision in the situation. You can tell them to move their bishop into enemy territory, but they won’t know why that’s a good idea. You can tell them to use shorter headlines to rank higher in Google, but… you get the idea.

### Perspective: None
Novices also don’t know what variables in the skill are worth focusing on and which ones aren’t. They want to look at everything at once. They can easily get overwhelmed by too much information, which causes them to freak out and get exasperated and wonder how anyone can possibly be good at what they’re doing.

The novice driver tries to look at every gauge and road variable, the novice marketer tries to track every metric, the novice cook keeps checking the food every few seconds.

### Decision Making: Analytical
Since the novice doesn’t have an intuitive sense for the skill, their decision making is analytical. They look at the data they have, plug it into the recipe, and go with whatever the recipe spits out. The oven hits 10 minutes and they flip over the steak. The car hits 10mph and they shift to 2nd gear. They get their fifth set of 5 reps and they add 5 pounds.

### Engagement: Detached
Since the novice is only following a recipe, they’re completely detached from the process. They don’t have an emotional or intuitive investment in the goal setting, deciding what to do, or the outcome. When something goes wrong they will blame the process, when something goes right they will say it’s a good process. They have no personal involvement in what’s happening.

### The Challenge
The challenge with being at the novice level should be obvious. When you can only follow recipes, you get derailed very, very easily. Your reaction to errors is to blame the recipe, and without a good system for troubleshooting on your own, you can get stuck.

# The Advanced Beginner Stage

The novice becomes an advanced beginner when they can start to troubleshoot their problems and work on their own. You’re still primarily using recipes, but you have more contextual awareness of when to use which recipes.

The defining characteristic of the Advanced Beginner is recognizing “aspects” of a situation. You can see what’s different about one situation and move through the layers of abstraction and use that information to apply different recipes and guidelines to solve the problem.

You don’t have a full “big picture” view of the skill yet, but you’re starting to develop more context and are not completely lost when something goes wrong. Instead of blaming the recipe when you hit an error, you know to look for another recipe.

Finally, you start to be able to use less rigorous “maxims” instead of recipes. A novice won’t understand “shift up when the engine sounds like it’s racing,” but an advanced beginner will.

### Context: None -> Situational
While the Novice has no context of what recipes to use when the Advanced Beginner has a better idea of what recipes are relevant and can start to use maxims in their decision making. They can combine situational information (the sound of an engine, the road conditions) with non-situational information (the speedometer) to figure out what to do.

This is only possible after a certain amount of exposure to the skill. A Novice won’t know what an engine should sound like, but after a while following the recipes, they can learn to identify these situational cues.

### The Challenge
While the Advanced Beginner can start to understand the context of the situation and make decisions based off of it, they still aren’t sure what information is relevant and don’t know how to filter their inputs. They can easily get overwhelmed by everything they feel they have to keep track of (especially as they absorb more recipes and maxims), and so they can feel like they’re never going to master it.

# The Competent Stage
As you progress through the Advanced Beginner stage, you add more and more recipes and maxims to your experience with the skill that help you perform better and better. Eventually, you hit the point where it’s completely overwhelming and you have to develop rules about what recipes to apply when.

The development of these rules is the key characteristic of the Competent. You have a better sense of what is relevant and what isn’t, and you can draw on a wide collection of recipes based on those situational rules.

These rules might sound like:

“Focus primarily on shutter speed when it’s a fast moving subject.”“The unbalanced pawn structure in this game is important because [other variables].”“To slow down off the highway, focus on speed, not changing gears.”“For this kind of article, I should apply SEO maxims like X, Y, Z”

The second characteristic of the Competent is that since you’re picking your rules and using those rules to apply different recipes, you become emotionally involved in the outcome.

While the Novice and Advanced Beginner are largely detached from the outcomes, the Competent can experience joy at making the right choice of recipes and remorse at choosing the wrong one. The locus of blame shifts from the recipe to yourself, since you are now involved in choosing what to do.

### Perspective: None -> Chosen
You’re starting to recognize what recipes and maxims apply in different situations and so you choose which ones to apply based on the context. You can look at a situation and decide which recipes to apply, instead of trying to apply them willy-nilly or based on someone else’s recommendation.

### Engagement: None -> Engaged Outcome
You still aren’t personally engaged in the deciding what your goal is or how to do it since you’re following rules, but you are engaged in the outcome since you decided which recipes to apply to the situation. This is great when you get it right, but frustrating when you get it wrong.

### The Challenge
Since you’re making decisions about what rules to apply and you’re emotionally involved in the outcomes, you can easily burn yourself out and exhaust your interest in the skill by getting things wrong.

# The Proficient Stage
As you react emotionally to your decisions at the level of Competence, your positive and negative responses to decisions will reinforce the correct ones and discourage the incorrect ones and you will develop an increasingly intuitive sense of what recipes and maxims to apply to the situation.

The defining characteristic of the Proficient is an intuitive sense of what the goal should be given the situation. While the Competent has to create or find rules for what to do in a situation, the Proficient has an intuitive sense of what the goal should be, but not necessarily exactly how to do it.

### Perspective: Chosen -> Intuitive
Whereas the Competent performer chooses what criteria to focus on and what recipes and maxims to use based on that, the Proficient performer knows what criteria to focus on. They’re absorbed enough in the skill to be able to intuit what data are important, and what aren’t.

### Engagement: Involved Outcome -> Involved Goal and Outcome
The second shift comes in moving from merely being involved in the outcome to being involved in the goal setting as well. Just as the Competent practitioner will have an emotional investment in a good outcome, the Proficient practitioner will have an emotional investment in a good outcome and good selection of goals.

# The Expert Stage
The Expert operates entirely by intuition. He or she knows what their goal should be, what to do about it, and what should happen as a result. They’re emotionally involved and invested in the whole process, and since they’re running on intuition, they might have a hard time explaining why they do things to non-experts.

### Context: Situational
They know what’s important and what isn’t, and can identify all the relevant pieces of the skill whether those are universal variables (car speed, piece value) or situational ones (road conditions, king position).

### Perspective: Intuitive
The expert knows what’s important and what isn’t and what they should focus on entirely intuitively. They don’t need to choose what to focus on and don’t need rules for it, they just know what’s important for setting their goals and devising a method.

### Decision Making: Intuitive
Whereas the first four levels of expertise still relied on analytical decision making by consciously deciding what the best course of action is, the expert intuitively knows what they should do and does it. They don’t need to explain the reasons, they can recognize it as they can recognize the face of a friend.

### Engagement: Involved Goals, Choices, and Outcomes
Because the whole process is intuitive, the expert is emotionally invested in the outcomes of each part of the process. They emotionally feel the rightness or wrongness of their intuitions at the goal, action, and result stages, and can use that feedback to improve their intuitive decision making.
